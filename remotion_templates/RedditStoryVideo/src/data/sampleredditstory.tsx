  "My friend got a girl pregnant when he was 13 and the girl was 15. They met at the beach in Panama City, Florida. She was rich and lived in Ohio, he was poor and lived in Georgia. My friend never told anyone but me. He is now 28 and has a 15 year old kid only I know about. The only reason he got away with it is because this girls family was super rich. The girl never said who the guy was and would sometimes fly down to visit him in secret. I did not believe this shit until I saw pictures of his kid. His kid has never met him either and I do not think he even knows he exists. I always daydreamed that if my friend died I would have to tell his parents that he actually had a kid and they had been a granma/granpa for 15 years and never knew it.";
